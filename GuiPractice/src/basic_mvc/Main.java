/**
 * This program represents a basic MVC architecture.
 *
 * <p>The model maintains a single string that is input by the user using the GUI
 * and echoed on the GUI.
 *
 * <p>The view is the GUI.
 *
 * <p>The controller reacts whenever the user presses a button. It acts as a
 * communicator between model and view, and thus separates them.
 *
 * <p>Advantages of this design:
 *
 * <p>1. Changing the GUI but not the functionality (model) is possible and clean.
 * 
 * <p>2. Using a new implementation of the model without changing view and
 * controller is possible.
 *
 * <p>Limitations of this design:
 *
 * <p>Handling keyboard and mouse events is not covered yet. This must be done in a
 * scalable manner, because the key mappings (which keys do what) should be
 * easily changeable, and should be changeable by the controller and not mandate
 * a rewrite of the view.
